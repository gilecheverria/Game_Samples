## Hints and solutions to common problems

- Avoid spaces in filenames. Prefer names in English.
- Do NOT erase assets from outside of Unity (terminal or GUI).
- Try to use the coordinates (0, 0, 0) as the origin of the game world.
- In general give child objects the position (0, 0, 0) to center them
    on their parent.
- Use default values in Unity so that the game can work,
    even if the API is not available.
- Collisions not detected? Check that colliders and RB correspond to 2D or 3D
